Snake Eater: get a playlist going in the ship with a change song button
Snake Eater: to make ur testing more fun
Snake Eater: wew
Milun: nah shuffle mode yo
Snake Eater: i want something like that in final game anyway
Milun: oh yeah definately
Milun: I was gonna ask you about that actually
Milun: now
Milun: the middle area
Milun: is spherical
Milun: in the middle
Milun: should we like have a core
Milun: just cos it seems like empty space
Milun: hold on Ill draw it up
Snake Eater: i know what u mean
Milun: WHEN I GET THE TEARS OUT OF MY EYES
Milun: yes I know this song is really shit
Milun: but the grip it has over my nostalgia
Milun: is unrivalled
Milun: ok
Milun: this is what I meant
Milun: http://i.cubeupload.com/I1kXnc.png
Milun: The pillars are there cos otherwise the ball would be floating in midair
Snake Eater: yeah i kno
Milun: .......turns head 90 degrees
Milun: goddamn it
Snake Eater: 1. its space
Milun: that was unintentional
Snake Eater: 2. fucking magnets
Milun: come now
Milun: you said
Milun: it's all 80s
Snake Eater: hmm ok
Milun: (Also I know you said it not literally
Snake Eater: thats where the shower sphere is
Milun: (but magnets and technology)
Snake Eater: i wanted to make it a power button of the DC before
Snake Eater: i guess it works here
Milun: no no no
Milun: what I was thinking
Milun: (I was NOT thinking of a shower at all)
Milun: (not going against you but thats just weird)
Milun: anyway
Milun: focus
Milun: ok
Snake Eater: what is it in the middle lol
Milun: I thought
Milun: that could be the media centre
Milun: as in
Milun: the music player
Snake Eater: hmm
Milun: or a huge ass camera that always watches you
Milun: when you walk in
Snake Eater: yes
Milun: ala Clankers Cavern
Snake Eater: now i like it
Milun: when you open the door
Milun: you just have a mechanical eye stare at you
Snake Eater: and it can double as media centre
Milun: and Wheatley can fuck off
Snake Eater: perrrfecct
Snake Eater: so you are gonna have poles connecting it?
Milun: not sure not
Milun: *now
Milun: Maybe one on top/bottom
Snake Eater: i honestly just like magnetized
Milun: yeah maybe you're right
Snake Eater: being in there in the middle
Milun: just gotta fill up space now lol
Snake Eater: things are explained in backstory tapes
Milun: the reason I bring it up
Milun: cos Im worried about having too much empty area
Snake Eater: no you've got a good point
Milun: well well see
Milun: second question
Milun: how does one
Milun: poke the eye
Milun: to make music play
Snake Eater: an eye is the screensaver
Milun: so it's a giant screen in the shape of a sphere
Snake Eater: ya
Milun: ooooooh
Milun: I like it
Milun: reminds me
Milun: of the Microsof
Milun: ...table?
Milun: whats it called
Snake Eater: surface
Milun: its just a huge ass touch screen
Snake Eater: loved that shit when i saw it ages ago
Milun: yeah
Milun: hmm
Milun: ok
Milun: lemme draw up a design
Milun: a few designs
Milun: ok
Milun: http://i.cubeupload.com/4T0tnt.png
Milun: theres other versions but these were the hardest to explain
Milun: also big thing
Milun: when you see the eye
Milun: or look at it
Snake Eater: just perfectly spherical
Milun: it needs to "focus" on you
Milun: just cos it's creepy
Snake Eater: agreed
Milun: now there are a few reasons
Milun: I suggested these designs
Milun: specifically the one on the right
Milun: its because Im worried that making it an accurate touch screen
Milun: will be a bitch
Milun: maybe theres a way to do it
Snake Eater: just thinking a menu shows up wherever the iris was
Milun: I know
Milun: but I dont think the actual model should rotate
Milun: as the eye does
Snake Eater: nor do i
Milun: I think it should move around on the thing like a real monitor
Snake Eater: agreed
Snake Eater: thats why it should be perfectly spherical
Milun: hm...
Milun: yeah
Milun: it wouldnt be able to see you otherwise
Snake Eater: is it an aethetic thing?
Snake Eater: because agreed the perfect spherical monitor
Snake Eater: would be a bit too future tech
Milun: I dunno
Milun: hm
Milun: ok
Milun: hold on
Milun: Ive got a few more ideas
Snake Eater: brb
Milun: ok
Milun: btw if you think the perfect sphere eye works Ill do my best
Milun: whether I can program it or not should NOT affect the design
Milun: Design wise I do have a preference, but I wont state it
Snake Eater is now Online.
Snake Eater: yes you will :P
Milun: Vwala
Milun: http://i.cubeupload.com/8NofSP.png
Milun: the looms over you one
Milun: implies it slowly floats behind you
Milun: while you're playing a game
Snake Eater: ...YES
Milun: and it operates on the boo principle
Snake Eater: i like the looms over you one best
Milun: where if you look at it
Milun: it stops
Milun: so you can poke it
Milun: it definately needs to cast a shadow
Snake Eater: aaaw yeah
Milun: alrighty
Milun: and good thing too
Milun: you picked the one I liked
Milun: (I actually threw that in by accident when I offcentered the copy paste)
Milun: lel
Milun: ok
Milun: now for the final choice
Milun: is it still full a screen
Milun: *fully
Milun: considering it literally floats around
Milun: maybe the back half can be more tech?
Milun: *tech-y
Milun: like a metal plate
Milun: with wires around it
Snake Eater: yeah that works
Milun: also the bottom of the ship
Milun: and this is just throwing ideas at the wall
Milun: the bottom of the ship
Milun: can have a circular indent
Milun: which is the implied resting location of the eye
Milun: when it's powered down
Milun: (maybe if you're stealthing around and the power goes out you see it there, deactivated)
Snake Eater: hmm ok
Milun: stop me if you want
Snake Eater: ur right it should have a tech back
Snake Eater: so it can have small jets to actually move
Milun: you just sayin that
Milun: ah ok
Snake Eater: no im not :P
Milun: yep
Milun: also
Milun: probs dont make it move
Milun: while you're looking at it
Milun: so you can see the back of it
Milun: like it just freezes
Milun: and acts inconspicuous
Milun: so you dont suspect anything
Milun: I like this
Snake Eater: yeah i can see
Milun: this is creepy
Milun: suck it Hal
Milun: this is cooler
Milun: ok
Milun: lemme record this chat
Milun: (I wont work on this today cos too tired and requires hyper mega maths)
Snake Eater: oh u dont ahve to XD
